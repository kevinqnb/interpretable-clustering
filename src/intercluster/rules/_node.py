class Node():

    Node object to be used within a logical decision tree, with simple 
    axis aligned splitting conditions.
    
    Args:
        None
    Attributes:
        random_val (float): Uniform random sample used to split ties / and create
            a relative order of nodes. Note that in the creation of the tree, nodes are chosen
            based on their cost, and this value is simply used to break ties. 
            
        type (str): Internally set to 'node' or 'leaf' depending on if the node is a
            normal node or a leaf node.

        leaf_num (int): (For leaf nodes only) Leaf identifying number.
            
        label (int): (For leaf nodes only) Prediction label to be associated with this node.
        
        left_child (Node): (For non-leaf nodes only) Pointer to the left branch of the current node.
        
        right_child (Node): (For non-leaf nodes only) Pointer to the right branch of the 
            current node. 
        
        condition (Condition): Logical or functional condition for evaluating and 
                splitting the data points.
        
        cost (float): The cost associated with points belonging to this node.
            
        indices (np.ndarray): The subset of data indices from the training set 
            belonging to this node.
        
        depth (int): The depth of the current node in the tree.
